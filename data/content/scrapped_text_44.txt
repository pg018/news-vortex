so what’s driving nippon steel’s big bet?
the main reason is nippon’s  ambition to vastly expand its international presence.
“this acquisition aligns with nippon steel’s global strategy” the company said in a  (pdf) published monday detailing its purchase of us steel.
nippon  is focusing its expansion efforts on three regions india where robust demand growth is expected; its home market in asia; and the us the world’s largest market for high-grade steel. both new delhi’s  and washington’s efforts —  — to  to the us are also expected to drive demand for nippon steel’s products and technologies.
relatively cheap energy in the us will further encourage manufacturers to move back there in turn driving steel demand nippon  noted. plus the us has low-cost iron ore mines with abundant reserves.
meanwhile the us steel acquisition propels nippon  closer to its goal of  reaching 100 million metric tons of crude steel output per year. us steel’s annual steep output of 20 metric tons immediately raises nippon’s annual global production capacity to 86 million metric tons.  nippon aims to produce 60% of its steel outside of japan.
